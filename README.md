# Centaur
Custom plugin for the Camunda BPM cockpit webapp.

Centaur is a group of Computer science students working to create an advanced dashboard
for the Information Systems Group. This dashboard will be supplied in the form of a plugin
that builds upon the existing cockpit feature of the open-source Camunda BPM software.
This research group is one of the participants of the overarching HORSE project.
The HORSE project aims to bring a new industrial solution that involves a flexible model of
smart factory involving the efficient collaboration of humans, robots and machinery. Using 
existing technology and research in robotics and smart factories, the researchers and collab-
orators participating in the project integrate this knowledge in a coherent framework.

The innovative approaches of HORSE are the integration of efficient human-robot interaction,
intuitive human-machine interfaces and interaction between different robots and machines.
On top of that, the reduction of health risks and safety of the human worker will contribute to
an improved production process.

The suitability of the resulting framework is driven and validated with manufacturing compa-
nies. These end-users participate in both the development and validation of the framework.

In the former stage, selected end-users will participate in so-called Pilot Experiments. In the
latter stage, new end-users are recruited to validate the suitability.
Centaur strives to make a tailor-made dashboard that has the right functionalities built in
as needed for the proposed solution of the HORSE project. The aim of the dashboard is
to provide operation managers an overview of all processes and their statuses in a smart
factory. The visualisation of this information should happen in an intuitive way such that the
right information can be attained with a quick glance. Besides that, the dashboard should
be able to display important parameters such as process variables, KPIâ€™s (Key Performance
Indicators) and it should provide insight of the current status of activities in the process model.
Finally, the usability should be on such a level that the experience of using this dashboard is
pleasant and foolproof.
